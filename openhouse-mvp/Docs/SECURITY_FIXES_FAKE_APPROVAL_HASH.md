# Security Fixes: Fake Approval Hash Vulnerability

## Critical Issue Identified

**Date**: December 2024  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Issue**: Fake approval hashes were being accepted in the reservations API, allowing unauthorized property funding and token deployment.

## Root Cause

The `/api/reservations` endpoint was:
1. Accepting user-supplied `approval_hash` without verification
2. Automatically marking `payment_status = 'approved'` based on user input
3. Allowing fake records to enter the funding pool
4. Enabling token deployment based on unverified data

**This violated core OpenHouse principles:**
- ❌ Rule #4: No mock data
- ❌ Rule #15: All data must be verifiable  
- ❌ Security principle: All data must be cryptographically verified

## Evidence of Compromise

**London Flat Property (795d70a0-7807-4d73-be93-b19050e9dec8)**:
- Had a real token contract deployed at `0x3e4263dfe9a2b28bbfc30666a67eb53e197e7560`
- Contract deployment was based on fake approval hash: `0xc308ab657a5882a0c3b8b3e0ac0b63e2455c2305e1c824d1e1110a6708067f64`
- This fake hash was never verified against on-chain USDC approval events

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Database Remediation
- Marked fake approval hash as `invalid_fake_hash` status
- Flagged London Flat property as `flagged_fake_data`
- Removed all unverified payment authorizations
- Cleared token contract address from compromised properties

### 2. API Security Hardening

**Reservations API (`/api/reservations/route.ts`)**:
- ✅ Added on-chain USDC approval verification
- ✅ Validates approval hash format (66 characters, starts with 0x)
- ✅ Verifies transaction exists and succeeded on-chain
- ✅ Decodes USDC approval events from transaction logs
- ✅ Validates owner, spender, and amount match reservation
- ✅ Only marks as approved after cryptographic verification

**Admin APIs**:
- ✅ Deploy Token API: Blocks operations on flagged properties
- ✅ Collect USDC API: Blocks operations on flagged properties

### 3. Admin Panel Updates
- ✅ Added visual indicators for flagged properties (red/orange badges)
- ✅ Disabled all actions on flagged properties
- ✅ Clear messaging when properties are flagged

## Technical Implementation

### On-Chain Verification Function
```typescript
async function verifyUSDCApproval(
  approvalHash: string,
  expectedOwner: string,
  expectedAmount: number
): Promise<{ isValid: boolean; error?: string }>
```

**Verification Process**:
1. Fetch transaction receipt from Base Sepolia
2. Verify transaction succeeded (`status === 'success'`)
3. Filter logs for USDC contract events
4. Decode `Approval` events using ABI
5. Validate parameters:
   - `owner` matches wallet address
   - `spender` matches treasury address  
   - `value` is sufficient for reservation amount

### Validation Script
Created `scripts/validate-existing-approvals.js` to:
- Audit all existing payment authorizations
- Verify approval hashes against on-chain data
- Mark invalid entries and flag affected properties
- Generate detailed validation reports

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- Approval hash must be exactly 66 characters
- Must start with `0x` prefix
- Must be a valid transaction hash

### 2. On-Chain Verification
- Every approval hash verified against Base Sepolia
- USDC contract events decoded and validated
- Transaction success status confirmed

### 3. Database Integrity
- Only cryptographically verified approvals marked as approved
- Flagged properties cannot be used for operations
- Clear audit trail of all validation actions

### 4. Admin Controls
- Flagged properties clearly marked in admin panel
- All operations blocked on compromised properties
- Admin review required to clear flagged status

## Current Status

**✅ Vulnerability Closed**: No new fake approvals can be created  
**✅ Database Clean**: All fake entries removed or flagged  
**✅ Operations Secured**: Flagged properties blocked from operations  
**✅ Monitoring Active**: Validation script available for ongoing audits

## Properties Status

| Property | Status | Action Taken |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| London Flat | `flagged_fake_data` | Token contract cleared, operations blocked |
| Manchester Studio | `active` | Clean, available for legitimate funding |

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Run full validation of all payment authorizations
node scripts/validate-existing-approvals.js

# Check property status
node -e "/* Supabase query to check properties */"
```

## Prevention Measures

1. **Never trust user input** for verification status
2. **Always verify on-chain** before marking as approved
3. **Implement proper logging** for all verification attempts
4. **Regular audits** using validation scripts
5. **Clear flagging system** for compromised data

## Compliance

This fix ensures OpenHouse maintains:
- **Transparency**: All funding is verifiable on-chain
- **Compliance**: No fake data in the system
- **Security**: Cryptographic verification of all approvals
- **Auditability**: Clear trail of all validation actions

**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Verification**: Complete on-chain verification implemented  
**Next Review**: Ongoing monitoring via validation scripts
